# File-Backup-Scripting

## Overview
This Bash script is designed to create backups of directories or files. It allows you to specify a source directory or file that you want to back up and a destination directory where backups will be stored. Each backup is saved in a separate folder with a timestamp, making it easy to manage and access your backups.
